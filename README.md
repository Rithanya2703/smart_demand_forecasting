# Smart Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

This project builds an industry-grade machine learning system to forecast restaurant demand and optimize inventory.

## Business Problem
Restaurants face losses due to overproduction (wastage) and underproduction (stock-outs).
This system predicts demand using historical sales, weather, and event data and recommends optimal inventory levels.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- MLflow
- FastAPI / Streamlit
- Git & GitHub

## Project Status
🚧 In progress – Phase 1: Problem framing & data simulation
